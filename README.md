Here are some key features of the tool:
ðŸ”¹ Key Logging: The tool captures every key press on the keyboard, including both regular keys and special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt), and logs them to a file for monitoring and analysis.

ðŸ”¹ User Interaction: The tool operates in the background, continuously listening for key presses. It logs each keystroke with a timestamp, providing a comprehensive record of all keyboard activity.

ðŸ”¹ Logging Mechanism: The tool uses the logging module to save the captured keystrokes to a text file, making it easy to review and analyze the logged data.

ðŸ”¹ Handling Special Keys: The tool differentiates between regular keys and special keys, ensuring that all types of key presses are accurately recorded.

ðŸ”¹ Practical Application: This project demonstrates the practical application of Python for security monitoring, showcasing the ability to implement keylogging for legitimate security purposes, such as monitoring authorized activities or conducting security audits.
